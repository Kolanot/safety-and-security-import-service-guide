# Safety and security import service guide

Version 1.0 issued 27 March 2020
***

This guide explains how you can integrate your software with our APIs to submit an import notification known as an Entry Summary Declaration (ENS). It shows how the APIs fit into various end-to-end user journeys. It is intended to help software developers, designers, product owners or business analysts understand how your software needs to interact with HMRC systems.

## Overview
<!-- Section owner: MTD Programme -->

The Import Control System (ICS) handles electronic communications between:

* 	customs administrators, carriers or their appointed representatives

The process you must follow for goods being brought into the UK customs territory from the EU is for carriers to provide customs authorities with advance information, by way of ENS. 


ICS is designed to incorporate the:

* lodging, handling and processing of ENS in advance of the arrival of goods
* safety and security risk analysis and the exchange of results between member states
* issue of a Movement Reference Number (MRN). The MRN is a customs computer system generated number that is automatically allocated after successful validation. The MRN must be issued to the carrier and, where different, the declarant

The electronic ENS must be lodged before arrival into the UK - before loading in the case of maritime deep sea containerised.
The carrier or their authorised representative submitting the ENS must have a valid GB Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) number. For more information, see EORI Guidance 
 
For more information on ICS, see <<insert link to policy information>>
